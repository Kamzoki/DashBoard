# DashBoard
This is a side project I was working on it on my free time. I finished and published this website to a local server of mine in four days. It supports long polling as a method of real time dashboard updating and two seperate clients, one for administators and the other is for users.  I used asp.net mvc5 and SQL server for this project
I used Javascript for front-end dev and I had a friend of mine write the CSS for me.
